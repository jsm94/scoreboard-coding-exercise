# SCORE BOARD CODING EXERCISE

This coding exercise consist to provide the implementation of the Football World Cup Score Board as a simple library.

## Guidelines Keys

-   Keep it simple.
-   Simple implementation. NOT REST API, Web Service or Microservice.
-   Quality. TDD, OO Design, Clean Code and SOLID.
-   I choose to use plain JavaScript so the solution would be a simple module.

## Tooling

This project was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). I always been curious about this bundler (because is amazingly fast) so I decide to use on this coding exercise just for fun.

_Other tools:_

-   Vitest - it's fast
-   JSDoc - provide documentation, autocompletion and soft type check

## Assumptions

-   Assume that a team can only exist on one game in the scoreboard
-   Assume that scores should be positive numbers
-   Assume that the item's index on the scoreboard represents its position added to the system

## Setup proyect

1. Clone the repository
2. execute -> `npm install`

-   _execute tests_ -> `npm run test`
-   _execute coverage report_ -> `npm run test:coverage`
-   _show example with simple score board module summary implementation_ -> `npm run dev`
